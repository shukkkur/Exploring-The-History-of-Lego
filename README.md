# Exploring-The-History-of-Lego
Using a variety of data manipulation techniques to explore different aspects of Lego's history.

The Rebrickable database includes data on every LEGO set that has ever been sold; the names of the sets, what bricks they contain, what color the bricks are, etc.

In this project, we will get to explore the Rebrickable database and answer a series of questions related to the history of Lego.
